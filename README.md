## üåê Objective<a name="objective_Barriers_Across_Borders"></a> ##

We hope that by mapping the stories of graduating international students at UCLA and sharing the experiences of those who face career-related opportunity barriers will alleviate their distress regarding their future and their immigration status through solidarity and information. We aim to achieve our goal by creating a map for international students to share their experiences with employment opportunities in the US.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Who is being empowered?<a name="empowered_Barriers_Across_Borders"></a> ##

Getting an internship or a post-graduation career is one of the main objectives of students at UCLA or any university. While everyone struggles at some level with these objectives, it is particularly difficult, if not impossible, for international students due to their immigration status. Our project sets out to help provide resources for this group of international students, where little or no resources exist today. This is important because it affords these students in the US the opportunities that might be part of their dream, their goals, or even how they want to start their lives in a new country. We have personally met many international students that stress more over finding an internship than getting a good grade in their class. We believe this project will have a significant impact in not only providing very important and useful information for finding an internship or job but also bringing the international community closer in our shared pursuits of a better life.

## üßë‚Äçüíª What technology was used?<a name="technology_Barriers_Across_Borders"></a> ##

The website for the project was built using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps, was used to create the map and display the user stories. Information was collected using Google Forms, and the locations were geocoded in Google Sheets. 

## ‚ùî How it can be repurposed?<a name="repurposed_Barriers_Across_Borders"></a> ##

The potential long-term impacts of this project are both to give a voice to graduating international students who have experienced the employment opportunity barriers directly, as well as to help newer international students at UCLA to revisit the website and gain insight from those students regarding a direction to go in while looking for an entry into the workforce. If successful, part of our project can potentially be given to platforms such as the UCLA Dashew Center or the UCLA Career Center, and student-based organizations at UCLA such as alumni associations and International Student Association (ISA) at UCLA which focus on international students, to expand on this project and assist the graduating students both practically and mentally. For example, these organizations could potentially conduct workshops for international students by using our project and letting them know of the common struggles that they are likely to go through when attempting to find internships and/or career opportunities upon graduation. They can also use the information to give students better leads to finding jobs.
